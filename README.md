# shiftcal

# This is the source code for the Shift/Pedalpalooza Calendar.

The purpose of the Shift/Pedalpalooza Calendar is to empower citizens to create and view bike events and to spread bike fun.

This repository has been sanitized of passwords from the copy running at http://shift2bikes.org/betacal , but if you'd like to see it in action that's where to check it out.

## Basic Architecture

The front-end uses jQuery, Mustache templates, and Bootstrap.

The back-end uses Flourish php and MySQL.

## How to setup & run locally

1. First install docker (only tested on linux and mac)
2. `cd` to the shiftcal directory
3. Run `./nift up`
4. Get a mysql dump from One
5. Temporarily move the dump into the shiftcal directory
6. Run `cat dump.sql | ./nift mysql-pipe`
7. Make a copy of `config.php.example` and rename it `config.php`
